# Tulip

Tulip is a customizable application for creating static or D3 based maps.  Named for the [Impossible Black Tulip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunyu_Wanguo_Quantu).

You can use Tulip at [code.minnpost.com/tulip](http://code.minnpost.com/tulip/).  The project is still under heavy development and many features are still planned.

## About

Tulip is a web interface built on top of [Simple Map D3](http://code.minnpost.com/simple-map-d3/).  It allows you to make a custom map using any GeoJSON or TopoJSON data source.  If you data source has numerical properties, you can create a "choropleth" style map.

(coming soon)  Tulip is fully customizable so that it can be deployed for an organization or individual with specific configuration options already set or removed so that the design of maps can be controlled.

Inspiration take from [ChartBuilder](https://github.com/Quartz/Chartbuilder).

## Examples

(coming soon)

## Deployment

(coming soon)  The idea is that you should not fork the project; you should use it as a library in your own app.
